python_algorithms
=================
This is my repo that demonstrates many of the mathematical algorithms
and functions I created during my sophomore year in 15112:Fundamentals of Computer Science.

The repo features an algorithms directory, visualizations for graphical work using
Pythons graphics module TKinter, Object oriented work and even a few simple games we developed.
